/*  PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) sampling done in hardware via pin interrupts and PIT timer.
    
    I am using one, out of 4 PIT timers build into the Teensy 3.0.
    
    Pins used for PWM signal capture are fully definable by the user.
    However, i do recommend avoiding FLEX timer enabled pins, (Teensy 3.0 pin numbering) 5, 6, 9, 10, 20, 21, 22, 23,
    as those are used for PWM signal generation (for Electronic Speed Controllers).
    
    Using the hardware timer for timing / counting the pulses gives us superior accuracy of ~21 nano seconds.
    
    This receiver code also utilizes a more advanced failsafe sequence.
    In case of receiver malfunction / signal cable damage, RX Failasefe will kicks in
    which will start auto-descent sequence.
